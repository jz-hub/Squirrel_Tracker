# Squirrel_Tracker(WIP)

Final Project for Tools for Analytics.

Created by: Jackie Zhang, Guanchao Qi

## Description
This website is aiming to track all the known squirrels, starting with Central Park in New York City. We firstly imported [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).
The website also allows users to add, update and view squirrel data.
